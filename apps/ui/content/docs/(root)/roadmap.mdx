title: Roadmap
description: Where LoveUI is today and what we’re building next.
---

LoveUI has graduated from internal tooling to a public release. The goal is to give teams a layered system—primitives, particles, atoms, and backgrounds—that can be copied, themed, and shipped without a custom design system sprint.

## Now shipping

- **Primitives**: 40+ Base UI powered building blocks with LoveUI tokens and docs.
- **Particles**: Launch collection of application-level patterns pulled straight from production interfaces.
- **Backgrounds**: Procedural visuals (Ether, Silk, Gradiant Blinds) tuned for both marketing pages and product surfaces.
- **Docs tooling**: llms.txt support, Copy Markdown buttons, and AI-friendly code layout.

## In progress

- **Accessibility sweeps** to make every primitive axe-clean with a11y test coverage.
- **Design tokens v2** with expanded motion, depth, and typography scales.
- **Next.js starters** that ship with LoveUI wired in, including routing, SEO, and analytics defaults.
- **CLI upgrades** for project diffing, per-component updates, and optional TypeScript path aliasing.

## Up next

- **Atoms**: API-aware components (auth, scheduling, billing) that speak Cal.com services out of the box.
- **Theme packs** that layer on opinionated brand palettes, typography stacks, and motion presets.
- **Editor integrations** so you can browse, insert, and update components from VS Code and Cursor.
- **Design files** translated to Figma so product teams can ideate and spec in parallel.

## Watching

- **React Native bridge** for Expo + Universal Router.
- **Storybook kit** that mirrors the docs examples for local design review.
- **Enterprise distribution** with private npm feeds and support SLAs.

We publish changelog entries as soon as a item lands, so subscribe to the [LoveUI updates](/ui/docs/changelog) feed or follow @loveui on X for real-time progress. Feedback and pull requests are welcome—most roadmap items started as requests from the community.
