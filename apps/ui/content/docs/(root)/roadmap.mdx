title: Roadmap
description: Where LoveUI is today and what we’re building next.
---

LoveUI was built from the start as a public, open system for teams who want production‑ready UI without running a full design system sprint. It’s meant to be something you can copy, theme, and ship right away—while still staying consistent and scalable as your product grows.

## Now shipping

The **initial release** of LoveUI is here. It includes the foundation of the layered system and everything you need to start shipping real interfaces.

- **Building blocks** – Core primitives built with Base UI and LoveUI tokens. These are accessible, theme‑ready components you can drop into any React app.
- **Features** – Higher‑order LoveUI patterns (like dashboards, billing flows, onboarding) that stitch primitives into production‑ready experiences.
- **Backgrounds** – Procedural visuals like Ether, Silk, and Gradient Blinds for use in product surfaces or marketing pages.
- **Docs tooling** – AI‑friendly MDX layouts, llms.txt support, and copy‑to‑clipboard snippets for a smooth developer workflow.

## In progress

Work is ongoing to broaden the foundation and speed up the jump from idea to launch.

- **New backgrounds** – Adding more immersive procedural canvases and texture presets.
- **Page templates** – Full composable page scaffolds (e.g. landing, dashboard, auth) to accelerate product setup.
- **Accessibility sweeps** – Refining every component to meet a11y best practices with automated test coverage.
- **Design tokens v2** – Expanded motion, depth, and typography scales for expressive theming.
- **CLI upgrades** – Smarter diffing, per‑component updates, and optional TypeScript path aliasing for clean imports.

## Up next

Next, the focus shifts toward starter experiences and richer customization paths.

- **Starter apps** – Opinionated Next.js and Bun projects with routing, SEO, analytics, and LoveUI pre‑wired.
- **Theme packs** – Curated brand palettes, font stacks, and motion presets for instantly cohesive styling.
- **Editor extensions** – VS Code and Cursor integrations so you can browse, insert, and sync components without leaving your editor.
- **Design files** – Figma assets and layouts so design and dev teams can iterate in parallel.
